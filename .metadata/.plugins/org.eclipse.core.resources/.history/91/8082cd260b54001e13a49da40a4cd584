###Classes###

	Book Class: the Book class contains attributes for every column of the csv file. Anything with text
is stored as a string, any number with a decimal point is stored as a float, and any number without
a decimal point is stored as an integer. 

	BookList: the BookList abstract class contains a list of objects of the Book class which is used to store
the data pulled from the csv file. It also contains every function that is present in the BookArrayList
and BookLinkedList classes, though many of them are abstract and only present to ensure both subclasses
have all required functions. BookLinkedList and BookArrayList both inherit from BookList. 

###Functions###

	All functions are present in both BookArrayList and BookLinkedList with identical results.
